Generic single-database configuration.

### Adding a new model or changes
1. We need to run the definition of our models by import the corresponding scripts. For example,
`from models.user import User`

2. Create a migration script.
`alembic revision --autogenerate -m "<your message>"`
    
3. Running the migration to update the database.
`alembic upgrade head`
    

### Other basic and useful commands

1. `alembic current`
2. `alembic history --verbose`
3. `alembic upgrade <revision>`. For example, `alembic upgrade +2` migrates 2 version ahead. `alembic upgrade ae10+2` upgrades to revision 2 steps ahead of `ae1027a6acf`. `alembic upgrade head` upgrades revision to latest revision.
4. `alembic downgrade <revision>`. For example, `alembic downgrade -1` reverses the current migration by 1 revision. `alembic downgrade base` migrates revision to the very beginning.
